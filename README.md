# LogRun
### Overview
LogRun is a website I made to record my running because I'm yet to find a satisfying one online.

### Features
- Title
- Distance
- Time
- Date
- Run Type - solo, group, race, other textbox
- Background and Text Color (how it's displayed in the actual log list)
- Details - open-ended, for things like structure or feel, 400 character limit

### Things I Could Add
- [ ] Custom Preset Colors for your common type "Other" inputs (like if you type in your club's name in the other textbox, the color options will change based on a preset so you don't have to manually input the color each time)
- [ ] Better/Fancier CSS - I only know the very basics, so it would be cool to add nicer-looking stuff I've seen on other people's websites
- [ ] Edit and delete function for past runs
